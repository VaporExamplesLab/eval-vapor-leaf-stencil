_Templating Language Considerations_

Benefits:

* Expressive: does just one thing. 
* Declarative: stateless. separation of concerns. not imperative.

Costs:

* Stack Complexity: adds another language to the stack.
* Social Cost: other team members need to learn language. templating languages are not standardized.
* Less Tooling: e.g. syntax highlighting plugin, etc.
